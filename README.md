This is a Discord bot that I'm using in my own personal Discord server and also serves as a learning process for Hikari and Tanjun API's, which is a new Python Discord API after the terminated development of discord.py. I have decided to go with Tanjun instead of Lightbulb as the former offers more capabilities and features compared to Lightbulb and want to try learning a new format 

The bot code will be pushed as is and code commenting will only be done where I find myself necessary.

This is a Discord bot that I'm using in my personal Discord server and also serves as a bot for me to learn Hikari and Tanjun API's, which is a new Python Discord API after the terminated development of discord.py. There's two command handlers for Hikari, Lightbulb and Tanjun, however I have decided to go with Tanjun as the latter offers more capabilities and features compared to Lightbulb and want to try learning a new format.
